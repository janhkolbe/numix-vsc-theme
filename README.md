# Numix Theme for Visual Studio Code
This theme is still work in progress and I don't recommend anyone to use it yet! This theme is also not part of the official [Numix project](https://github.com/numixproject)!

## About
I created this theme to have Visual Studio Code integrate into my Numix desktop a little more elegantly. It provides Numix style UI colors and either a dark or light editor color theme with matching terminal styling.

## Installation
This is still work in progress and therefore not released as an official theme.

If you want to try it anyway, you can just clone this repository into your themes directory, restart Visual Studio Code and select Numix (Dark Editor) or Numix (Light Editor) as your color theme.
